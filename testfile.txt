Testing my first file in VIM
Learning the commands and how to navigate using the manual available

I have no idea what I'm doing as yet but this is pretty interesting so far

So far I learnt how to create and save a new file. Made a slight error with the first one but I'm going to get a bit more acquainted with this.

I will be using this file to document my progress and to test other commands with.
